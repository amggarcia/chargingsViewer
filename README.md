## Project Scope

This was a quick project to create a web app that allowed to collect information from files with a specific XML schema.

This information is then displayed for easier reading as well as show the sums, of the values grouped by one of two properties.

This was a quick project done in react to get more experience with the framework, but was hacked up pretty fast, so if any further extensions are to be done to this project, some code cleanup and refactor will be needed.

Points that can be improved : 
    The parsing of the XML files isnt that safe and can cause unexpected problems if diferent schemas are uploaded.
    Types of files are not being properly checked so you can upload other filetypes when it should not be possible.
    Some more dinamism should be implemented if other file schemas are suposed to be used.

All in all this is just a quick and dirty mock up.
